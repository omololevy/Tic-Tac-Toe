## Description
This program allows players to;

* Input something among 1-9 to select a slot
* If they enter anything else, it tells them to go again.
* Check if the input is already taken
* Toggle between users upon succesful move
* Add input to the board
* Check if user won: checking rows, columns and diagonals
</br>


## Rules
* The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to get three "X" or "O" in a row, column or diagonally (known as win-state), played on a three by three game board. 
* The first player is known as X since his/her input are "Xs" and the second is O coz his/her input are "Os". 
* Players alternate placing "Xs" and "Os" on the game board until either oppent has either of the three **win-state** or all nine squares are filled (The latter occurs only in stalemate/draw). 
* X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
