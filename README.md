## Rules
* The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. 
* The first player is known as X and the second is O. 
* Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. 
* X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
